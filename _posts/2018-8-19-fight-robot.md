This was a 4 kg-class combat robot series competition, where I led a team of five to design and manufacture several wheeled robots. The contest had a set of specifications for robot size and technology, for instance, the robot's projection size before starting couldn't exceed 300mm x 300mm, and it was required to autonomously climb onto a 60mm high platform. Most crucially, the competition prohibited remote control of the robots, all movements and behaviors were based on sensors and microprocessors. In the summer of 2018, after overcoming many challenges, we achieved second place (first prize) in this project.
